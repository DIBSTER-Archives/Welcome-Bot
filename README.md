# Welcome-Bot
 A very simple Discord Welcome and Leave bot created in [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and is easy to configure.

# Prerequisite
 1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
 2. Prior knowledge of JavaScript and JSON. It literally is a "fill in the blank and your good to go" type of bot, but if you get errors, that's on you bud.
 3. A Discord bot token from the [Discord Developer Dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

# Configuration
 It doesn't take a rocket scientist to set this bot up.

 **Steps:**
 1. Change `example.config.json` located in the `src/Configuration/` folder, and rename it to `config.json`.
 2. Start filling out the information inside of the configuration file. If you don't, you bot won't run properly. Your Discord token is the thing you get from your dashboard.
 3. Run the following commands:
 ```js
npm install
node index.js
 ```
 4. Your good to go! Now you setup this bot, your all done.
